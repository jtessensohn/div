# Destiny Item Viewer
Destiny Item Viewer is a tool for looking at pllayer stats and items related to player's individual Guardians. Using Bungie's API, multiple request are made using input in the search bar to gather and store data related to the characters a player has. Upon choosing one of the characters, stats are displayed in both PvP and PvE activities.

## Coming Soonâ„¢
This project was made initially in less than a weeks time, so it's certainly not at its most complete. Here's a few things on the board to do in the future:
* Actually seeing an item
* Handling search responses that return multiple users
* Descritptive error pages
* More stats and cleaner format

## Technologies
* React (create-react-app)
* Tailwind
* Context
